# gcam_food_processing_breakout
This repository contains the scripts used for calculations and data visualizations for the food processing sector breakout in GCAM, as well as the spreadsheets used for calculations for technology non-energy costs and water use coefficients.

The documents folder contains useful documents, including the sector structure diagram, a document of research, a Zotero bibligraphy, and various presentations.

The initial_breakout_results folder contains the scripts for post-processing and generating figures for the validation runs (using output csvs) as well as an older script using rgcam. It also includes the figures from the 11/9/23 validation run.

The initial_exploration folder contains the script used to perform the energy data infilling (i.e., to calculate the relationship between food processing energy use and food consumption used to infill energy data for regions without high quality data from the IEA), as well as some other old scripts. It also includes figures associated with those scripts.

The mappings folder has relevant mappings used in various scripts and analysis.

The overall_nonenergy_costs_calc folder contains the script used to calculate the overall food processing sector non-energy costs using GTAP data, some relevant figures, and the resulting costs as a csv file.

The spreadsheets used for the calculations for food processing process heat technology non-energy costs and the overall sector water use coefficients are included separately.
